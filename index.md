## What We Do

We help **small to medium enterprises** build reliable analytics platforms — without over-engineering or long delivery cycles.

Every engagement delivers **end-to-end analytics**:

> **Data ingestion → Analytics-ready datasets → Dashboards**

The difference between tiers is **how much customization you need**,  
not whether the solution is complete.

*Typical engagements range from a few weeks for standardized setups to several months for complex platforms.*

## Our Philosophy

Most data projects fail because everything is built from scratch.

We do the opposite.

✔ Proven, standardized foundations  
✔ Clear boundaries on what’s configurable  
✔ Customization only where it adds real business value  

**The result:**

✔ Faster time to insight  
✔ Lower long-term maintenance cost  
✔ Systems that scale with your business

## Engagement Models

### Pricing Overview

| Tier | Engagement Type | Pricing
|----|----|----|
| **Standardized Analytics** | One-time project ( 3-6 months ) | From **USD 25,000**
| **Enterprise Analytics** | One-time project | Scope-based
| **Partnership** | Ongoing | Custom
| **Consulting & Advisory** | Time-based | Hourly / Daily

Exact pricing depends on data volume, sources, and delivery timeline.

### How Much You Are Savings

To build a Production Ready Data Platform and Analytics is not a small investment. You will need around
- 3 Data Engineers
- 1 Data Analyst
- 1 DevOps
- and 1 year time of development.
The initial cost can be as low as **USD 50,000**. Assuming that you paid the same infrastructure cost, our services saves you about half the initial cost and half the development time. This is possible due to the experience and standardized flow that we proposed. Not to mention everything is documented and is accessible to you.
